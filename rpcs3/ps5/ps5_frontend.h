// PS5: RPCS3's frontend on the console, in place of the Qt one.
//
// The title (PS5_RPCS3Title) calls rpcs3_ps5_run from its main thread after its
// own platform layer is up (klog, the pad, the shell's splash) and volk points
// at the RADV it links. RPCS3's files live under /app0/rpcs3/.
//
// What the title provides, so this frontend does not depend on its files:
// - the pads, read through rpcs3_ps5_title::poll_pads (below);
// - catchReturnFromMain(status), which asks the shell to close the title and
//   never returns: a fatal error ends through it (a title never calls exit).
